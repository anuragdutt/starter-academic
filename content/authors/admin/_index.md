I am a graduate student currently in my final year at Stony Brook University. I aspire to develop intelligent systems capable of addressing the fundamental problem of developing algorithms that can harness the power of large structured and non-structured datasets to solve real-world problems. In my free time, you can usually find me playing badminton, watching anime or reading high-fantasy novels. I am an avid gamer having played "Age of Empires" and "Defence of the Ancients" semi-professionally, and I have diploma in playing Tabla (An Indian percussion intrument).

I am always looking for research opportunities to work in field of Artificial Intelligence as I genuinely believe that data has the power to significantly the future progress of humanity.
