abstract: In this paper, we study the impact of accounting fraud revelation on trading behaviour of investors. Using daily investor account holdings data from the National Stock Depository Limited (NSDL), the largest depository in India, we find that investors directly exposed to accounting fraud cash out almost 10.7 percentage points of their overall portfolio relative to investors not directly exposed. The cashing out is largely restricted to the bad stock. Over the period of a month, however, there is no difference in the trading behaviour of the treated and control investors.
