title: Comparison of Adverserial techniques for synthesizing electronic health records - Data Management and Biomedical DataAnalytics Lab, SBU
summary: We compare the efficiency of multiple Generative Adverserial Networks frameworks such as GAN, AC-GAN and WGAN for generating discrete time-series of electronic health records on the MIMIC datase.

This project was undertaken as a part of our paper "SMOOTH-GAN: Towards Sharpand Smooth Synthetic EHR DataGeneration" to compare the performance of SmoothGAN architecture for generation of Electronic Health Records. We compare the performance of our architecture with other discrete distribution architectures such as MedGAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, AC-GAN and cGAN.
